## 🚀 About The Project

This project is a modern, responsive, and accessible form UI implementation featuring a **Dark Glassmorphism** aesthetic. It was built to solve the [Accessible Form UI](https://roadmap.sh/projects/accessible-form-ui) challenge on [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh).

While the visual style is futuristic—featuring neon accents, animated background blobs, and glass textures—the core focus remains on **accessibility** (A11y) and semantic HTML structure.

The unique aspect of this project is that **all animations**, including the circular progress chart and floating labels, are achieved using **Pure CSS** (no JavaScript libraries required for visuals).

## ✨ Features

### 🎨 Visuals & UI
* **Dark Glassmorphism:** Realized using `backdrop-filter`, semi-transparent backgrounds, and subtle border gradients.
* **Floating Labels:** Modern input fields where labels animate out of the way when focused (Google Material style).
* **Neon Glow Effects:** Interactive focus states and glowing buttons.
* **Dynamic Background:** Animated colorful blobs using pure CSS keyframes.

### ⚡ CSS Mastery
* **CSS `@property`:** Used to animate the circular progress chart gradient from 0% to 65% without JavaScript.
* **Staggered Animations:** Form elements and checklist items appear sequentially using `animation-delay`.
* **Responsive Grid:** Adapts seamlessly from a dual-column desktop layout to a single-column mobile view.

### ♿ Accessibility (A11y)
* **Semantic HTML:** Proper use of `<label>`, `<fieldset>`, and `<form>` tags.
* **Focus Management:** Clear, high-contrast focus indicators for keyboard navigation.
* **Screen Reader Friendly:** Usage of `aria-label`, `aria-live`, and `role` attributes where necessary.
* **Color Contrast:** Text colors adjusted to ensure readability against the dark glass background.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **HTML5** (Semantic & Accessible)
* **CSS3** (Variables, Flexbox, Grid, Keyframes, @property)
